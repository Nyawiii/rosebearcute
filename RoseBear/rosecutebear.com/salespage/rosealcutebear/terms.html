    Disclaimers; No Warranties.

  <p>
    The site, and all materials and user content available through the
    site, are provided “as is” and on an “as available” basis, without
    warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. The
    Fiora entities disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether
    express or implied, relating to the site, and all materials and user
    content available through the site, including: (a) any implied
    warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title,
    quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement; and (b) any warranty arising out
    of course of dealing, usage, or trade. The Fiora entities do not
    warrant that the site or any portion of the site, or any materials or
    user content offered through the site, will be uninterrupted, secure,
    or free of errors, viruses, or other harmful components, and do not
    warrant that any of those issues will be corrected.
  </p>
  <p>
    No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you
    from the site, or any materials or user content available through the
    site, will create any warranty regarding any of the
    Fiora entities or the site that is not expressly stated in these
    terms. You assume all risk for any damage that may result from your
    use of or access to the site, and any materials or user content
    available through the site. You understand and agree that you use the
    site at your own discretion and risk, and that you are solely
    responsible for any personal injury, death, damage to your property or
    third party property, or the loss of data that results from your use
    of or inability to use the site.

  <p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Fiora does not disclaim any
    warranty or other right that Fiora is prohibited from disclaiming
    under applicable law.

    Limitation Of Liability
  </h2>

  <p>
    In no event will the Fiora entities be liable to you for any
    indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages
    (including damages for loss of profits, goodwill, or any other
    intangible loss) arising out of or relating to your access to or use
    of, or your inability to access or use, the site, or any materials, or
    user content available through the site, whether based on warranty,
    contract, tort (including negligence), statute, or any other legal
    theory, and whether or not any Fiora entity has been informed of
    the possibility of damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Except as provided in section 17.4(iii), the aggregate liability of
    the Fiora entities to you for all claims arising out of or
    relating to the use of or any inability to use any portion of the site
    or otherwise under these terms, whether in contract, tort, or
    otherwise, is limited to $100.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    liability for consequential or incidental damages. Accordingly, the
    above limitation may not apply to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each provision of these terms that provides for a limitation of
    liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is
    intended to and does allocate the risks between the parties under
    these terms. This allocation is an essential element of the basis of
    the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable
    and independent of all other provisions of these terms. The
    limitations in this section 14 will apply even if any limited remedy
    fails of its essential purpose.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>
    <num>11.</num>
    General
  </h2>

  <p>You agree that the Site shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over
    Fiora, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms and any other
    agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms are the entire and exclusive understanding and
    agreement between you and Fiora regarding your access to the Site. Except as expressly permitted above,
    these Terms may be amended only by a written
    agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these
    Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior
    written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance
    of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by
    us of any breach or default of
    these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the
    provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the
    interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
    unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full
    force and effect. Upon termination of these
    Terms, Sections 3 through 19, along with the Privacy Policy and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.</p>

    Dispute Resolution And Arbitration
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>12.1 Generally:</strong>
    In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Fiora in the most expedient and cost effective
    manner, you and Fiora agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by
    binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator
    instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited
    review by courts. Arbitrators can award the
    same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out
    of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or
    any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.
    <u>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Fiora ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO
      A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</u>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>12.2 No Class Actions:</strong>
    <u>YOU AND Fiora AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
      AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</u>
    . Further, unless both you and Fiora agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
    person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
