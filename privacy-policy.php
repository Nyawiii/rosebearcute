    Information Collected or Received
  </h2>

  <p>
    In the course of providing our Services, we collect or receive your personal information in a few different
    ways. Often, you choose what information to provide, but sometimes we require certain information for you to
    use and for us to provide you the Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Registration, Account Setup, Service Usage:</strong>
    In order to use the Services, you need to provide us with a valid email address, and for Services that require
    registration, a name associated with your account that you can choose to represent your identity on
    RoseCuteBear. You may review, change, or remove that name through your account settings. You need to provide
    this information to enable us to provide you with the Services. Depending on which services you choose to use,
    additional information, such as a shop name, billing and payment information (including billing contact name,
    address, telephone number, credit card information), a telephone number, and/or a physical postal address, may
    be necessary in order for us to provide a particular service. You are not required to provide us with this
    information to sign up, but we will need it to provide certain services. For example, we need a physical
    postal address if you are buying something on the Site for delivery. As an RoseCuteBear seller, if you choose to
    use our payment service ("RoseCuteBear Payments"), RoseCuteBear may require information such as your full name,
    social security number, identification ID or tax ID, date of birth, bank account information, credit card
    information, and/or other proof of identification in order to verify your identity, provide this service to
    you, and comply with applicable law. We may need to store credit card information (or arrange for it to be
    stored) and use it for both billing and payment purposes. Depending on your local jurisdiction, you can also
    choose to allow us to save your credit card information to facilitate the checkout process for future
    purchases. RoseCuteBear may contact individual shop owners confidentially to request more information about
    their shops or items listed through the Services, or to ensure compliance with our rules and applicable law.
    In order to use certain products or services on RoseCuteBear, you may be required to complete an application;
    information that you submit through the application processes will not be displayed publicly and will only be
    used internally by RoseCuteBear, unless otherwise specified.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Profile:</strong>
    You may provide your name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) in connection
    with your account and activity. You can edit or remove this information through your account settings. The
    name associated with your account, which you may review and change in your account settings, is publicly
    displayed and connected to your RoseCuteBear activity. Other people may see the date you joined; ratings,
    reviews, and related photos for items you purchased or sold; your profile information; items you listed for
    sale; your shop pages and policies; your Favorites, followers, and those you follow; sold item listings and
    the number of items sold; comments you post in our community spaces; and information you decide to share via
    social networks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Automated Information:</strong>
    RoseCuteBear automatically receives and records information from your browser or your mobile device when you
    visit the Site or use the Apps or use certain other Services, such as your IP address or unique device
    identifier, cookies, and data about which pages you visit in order to allow us to operate and provide the
    Services. This information is stored in log files and is collected automatically. We may combine this
    information from your browser or your mobile device with other information that we or our partners collect
    about you, including across devices. This information is used to prevent fraud and to keep the Services
    secure, to analyze and understand how the Services work for members and visitors, and to provide advertising,
    including across your devices, and a more personalized experience for members and visitors.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Location Information:</strong>
    We may collect information about your use of the Services for advertising, for analytics, to serve content,
    and to protect the Services. This may include your IP address, browser information (including referrers),
    device information (such as iOS IDFA, IDFV for limited non-advertising purposes, Android AAID, and, when
    enabled by you, location information provided by your device). When you use the Apps, you may choose to share
    your geolocation details with RoseCuteBear in order to use functions like our local marketplace, maps, and for
    in-person sales (although you don't need to share these details). You may choose to publish your location when
    you sell on RoseCuteBear.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may obtain location information you provide in your profile or your IP address. With your consent, we may
    also determine location by using other information from your device, such as precise location information from
    GPS or information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device. We may use and store
    information about your location to provide features and to improve and customize the Services, for example,
    for RoseCuteBear’s internal analytics and performance monitoring; localization, regional requirements, and
    policies for the Services; for local content, search results, and recommendations; for shipping and mapping
    services; and (using non-precise location information) marketing. If you have consented to share your precise
    device location details but would no longer like to continue sharing that information with us, you may revoke
    your consent to the sharing of that information through the settings on the Apps or on your mobile device.
    Certain non-precise location services, such as for security and localized policies based on your IP address or
    submitted address, are critical for the site to function. We will only share your geolocation details with
    third parties (like our mapping, payments, or, to the extent applicable, advertising providers) in order to
    provide you with the Services. You may also choose to enable the Apps to access your mobile device’s camera to
    upload photographs to RoseCuteBear.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Analytics Information:</strong>
    We use data analytics to ensure site functionality and improve the Services. We use mobile analytics software
    to allow us to understand the functionality of the Apps on your phone. This software may record information
    such as how often you use the Apps, what happens within the Apps, aggregated usage, performance data, app
    errors and debugging information, and where the Apps were downloaded from. We do not link the information we
    store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information that you submit within the
    mobile application.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Information from Third Parties:</strong>
    Some members or visitors may choose to connect to RoseCuteBear or register an RoseCuteBear account using an
    external third-party application, such as Facebook, or an app developed using the RoseCuteBear API.
    RoseCuteBear may receive information from those connected third-party applications. Connecting your
    RoseCuteBear account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account
    to a third-party application, RoseCuteBear may receive information from that application. We may also collect
    public information in order to connect with you. We may use that information as part of providing the Services
    to you. You can also choose to share some of your activity on RoseCuteBear on certain social media networks
    which are connected to your RoseCuteBear account, and you can revoke your permission anytime in your account
    settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Non-Member Information:</strong>
    RoseCuteBear may receive or obtain information (for example, an email address or IP address) about a person who
    is not yet a registered RoseCuteBear member (a “non-member”) in connection with certain RoseCuteBear features,
    such as when a non-member chooses to subscribe to an RoseCuteBear newsletter, a member invites a non-member to
    visit the Site, a member uploads non-member information using the contact uploader feature, a non-member
    engages in a transaction, a member sends a gift card code to a non-member, or a non-member uses the Guest
    Checkout feature when making a purchase through one of the Services. Non-member information is used only for
    the purposes disclosed when it was submitted to RoseCuteBear or to facilitate action authorized by the
    non-member.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pattern by RoseCuteBear:</strong>
    We also collect certain information from both members and non-members who visit websites hosted by us. This
    information may include your IP address or unique device identifier, and cookies and data from the pages you
    visit. To learn more about websites hosted by us through Pattern by RoseCuteBear, see our Pattern Policy. For
    more information on our use of cookies and collection of tracking information, see our Cookies &amp; Similar

    Choice &amp; Control
  </h2>

  <p>
    We know that members of our community value having control over their own information, so RoseCuteBear gives you
    the choice of providing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact
    you. You may change or correct your RoseCuteBear account information through your account settings. You may also
    remove certain optional information that you no longer wish to be publicly visible through the Services, such
    as your name. You can also request the deletion of the personal information in your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may also have certain additional rights with respect to your information, such
    as: (i) data access and portability (including the right to obtain a copy of your personal data you provided
    to RoseCuteBear, via your settings); (ii) data correction (including the ability to update your personal data,
    in many cases via settings); (iii) data deletion (including the right to have RoseCuteBear delete your personal
    information, except information we are required to retain, by contacting us); and (iv) withdrawal of consent
    or objection to processing (including, in limited circumstances, the right to ask RoseCuteBear to stop
    processing your personal data, with some exceptions, by contacting us).
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from RoseCuteBear in your account settings.
    RoseCuteBear may send you messages about the Services or your activity. Some of these messages are required,
    service-related messages for members (such as transactional messages or legal notices). Other messages are not
    required, such as newsletters. You can control which optional messages you choose to receive by changing your
    account settings, and you can learn more in the “Messages from RoseCuteBear” section of this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use
    cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities
    and interests. If you have chosen to connect your account to an external third-party application, such as
    Facebook, or an app developed using the API, you can change your settings and remove permission for the app by
    changing your account settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many changes that you make to your account settings are updated immediately, but some may take a few days to
    take effect, particularly those that impact email or marketing preferences. Some major requests, such as
    changes to billing information or account data deletion, may require verification of identity before they can
    be processed.

    Findability
  </h2>

  <p>
    You may choose to connect directly with your email service provider, your mobile device’s address book, or a
    social network account to import your contacts to RoseCuteBear. We do not retain the login information for your
    email service, mobile device, or social network site. You may be able to search for people you know by email
    address or phone number on the Site or by connecting to your mobile device’s contact list through the Apps.
    Finding your friends on RoseCuteBear helps you connect with them on our platform. For example, you can follow
    another member’s public activity, such as public Favorites. When you begin following another member’s
    activity, they will receive an email notification (if the member has consented to receiving this type of
    email).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not want your contacts to be able to find you on RoseCuteBear through your email address, phone
    number, or social networking connections, then you may change your findability through your account settings.
    If you do not wish to be located on RoseCuteBear via your name, you can remove your name and instead may use a
    nickname or alias as your name in your public account information.

    Messages from RoseCuteBear
  </h2>

  <p>
    On occasion, RoseCuteBear may need to contact you. Primarily, these messages are delivered by email or by push
    notifications for a variety of reasons, including marketing, transactions, and service update purposes. If you
    no longer wish to receive push notifications, you can disable them at device level. You can opt out of
    receiving marketing communications via email in your account settings or by following the unsubscribe link in
    any marketing email you receive. To ensure you properly receive notifications, we will need to collect certain
    information about your device, such as operating system and user identification information. Every account is
    required to keep a valid email address on file to receive messages. RoseCuteBear may also contact you by
    telephone to provide member support or for transaction-related purposes if you request that we call you.
    Additionally, and with your consent, RoseCuteBear may send you an SMS (or similar) message in order to provide
    you with customer support or to provide you with information about products and features that you may find of
    interest. You may update your contact preferences in your account settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some messages from RoseCuteBear are service-related and necessary for members and Guest Checkout users. You
    agree that RoseCuteBear can send you non-marketing emails or messages, such as those related to transactions,
    your account, security, or product changes. Examples of service-related messages include an email address
    confirmation/welcome email when you register your account, notification of an order, service availability,
    modification of key features or functions, relaying Conversations with buyers, and correspondence with
    RoseCuteBear’s Support team.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you register for an account, subscribe to a newsletter, or provide us with your email address or phone
    number such as for a Guest Checkout purchase, you receive notice of and agree (in some jurisdictions and
    situations, by an additional unambiguous consent) to receive marketing emails and messages from us. You can
    unsubscribe at any time from marketing emails through the opt-out link included in marketing emails or
    messages. Members may also control which marketing emails or messages they receive from RoseCuteBear through
    their account settings. Please note that some changes to your account settings may take a few days to take
    effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    A contact-importer feature is available to help you locate and connect with your friends and contacts who may
    be members of RoseCuteBear (see the "Findability" section above for more information). If someone in your
    contact list is not already a member, you may invite them to join RoseCuteBear, and an email will be sent to
    them on your behalf. Recipients of email invitations may opt out of receiving future invitations by following
    instructions in the email invitation message. You may send an invitation only to someone who has given you
    consent to receive one.

  </h2>

  <p>
    When you access or use the Services, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information

      you;

      Necessary for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interests, such as those of visitors,

  <p>
    Note that we principally rely on consent (i) to send marketing messages, (ii) for third-party data sharing
    related to advertising, and, to the extent applicable, (iii) for the use of location data for advertising
    purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    We rely on consent for targeted online and offline marketing including through tools like Facebook Custom
    Audience and Google Customer Match. We or our sellers may advertise our Services or our sellers’ products
    through a variety of different mediums and rely on your consent to do so off-site. As part of this, we may
    work with advertising partners such as Facebook, Google, and other partners disclosed in our Cookies and
    Similar Technology Policy. Where we process your information on the basis of legitimate interests, we do so as
    follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Providing and Improving our Services:</strong>
    We may use your information to improve and customize our Services, including sharing of your information for
    such purposes, and we do so as it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests of improving our Services
    for our users. This is also necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate interests in understanding how our
    Services are being used, and to explore and unlock ways to develop and grow our business. It is also necessary
    to allow us to pursue our legitimate interests in improving our Services, efficiency, interest in Services for
    users, and obtaining insights into usage patterns of our Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Keeping our Services Safe and Secure:</strong>
    We may also use your information for safety and security purposes, including sharing of your information for
    such purposes, and we do so because it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in ensuring the
    security of our Services. This includes enhancing protection of our community against spam, harassment,
    intellectual property infringement, crime, and security risks of all kind.
  </p>
  <p>
    We respect your privacy. RoseCuteBear will not disclose your name, email address, or other personal information
    to third parties without your consent, except as specified in this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use your information to provide and improve the Services and our products, for billing and payments, for
    identification and authentication, and for general research and aggregate reporting. For example, in
    accordance with our existing case resolution process, we may use information you provide to resolve disputes
    with RoseCuteBear or other members. We may learn the sorts of products that you’re interested in from your
    browsing and purchasing behavior on (and off) the Site or Apps and suggest potential purchases as a result. As
    a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in customizing your on-site experience to help you
    search for and discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using this information to help
    sellers find the best ways to market and sell their products on RoseCuteBear. You may control your privacy
    settings through the opt-out buttons in your account settings privacy tab. Please note that some changes to
    your privacy settings may take a few days to take effect. We or our sellers may advertise our Services or our
    sellers’ products through a variety of different mediums and rely on your consent to do so off-site. As part
    of this, we may work with advertising partners such as Facebook or Google, and we may use analytics aggregated
    from usage information including, for example, search keywords, favorites, browsing history, and purchase
    history. In addition to consent as noted above, we also rely on our legitimate interest to send you marketing
    messages and for RoseCuteBear's advertising programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Buying and Selling:</strong>
    As part of the buying and selling process, RoseCuteBear will facilitate the sharing of information between the
    two members involved in the transaction, such as the other RoseCuteBear member's shipping address and payment
    status. This may also involve us sharing your information with some of our third party partners such as our
    shipping and payment partners to enable us to provide the service to you. By making a sale or a purchase on
    RoseCuteBear, you are directing us to share your information in this way. Since this is an important part of the
    Services we provide, we need to do this in order to perform our obligations under our Terms of Use. We expect
    you to respect the privacy of the member whose information you have received. As described in RoseCuteBear's
    Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use that information only for RoseCuteBear-related communications or
    for RoseCuteBear-facilitated transactions. RoseCuteBear has not granted a license to you to use the information
    for unauthorized transactions or sending unsolicited commercial messages in violation of any applicable laws,
    including any consent requirements of the jurisdiction of the recipient. You may only add a member to your
    email or physical mailing list or otherwise use or store a member’s personal information in accordance with
    applicable laws, including any consent requirements that apply in that member's jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Legal and Safety:</strong>
    RoseCuteBear may also retain, preserve, or release your personal information to a third party in the following
    limited circumstances: in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet legitimate
    national security or law enforcement requirements; to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or
    defend against legal claims, including to collect a debt; to comply with a subpoena, court order, legal
    process, or other legal requirement; or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably
    necessary to comply with the law, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or investigate, prevent,
    or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to our property, or violations of
    RoseCuteBear's Terms of Use. In these cases, our use of your information may be necessary for the purposes of
    our or a third party’s legitimate interest in keeping our Services secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing
    or defending legal rights, or preventing damage. Such use may also be necessary to comply with a legal
    obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend legal claims. It may also be necessary in the public
    interest (such as to prevent crime) or to protect vital interests (in rare cases where we may need to share
    information to prevent loss of life or personal injury).
  </p>
  <p>
    If RoseCuteBear receives a lawful, verified request for a member’s records or information in one of the limited
    circumstances described in the previous paragraph, RoseCuteBear may disclose personal information, which may
    include, but may not be limited to, a member’s name, address, phone number, email address, and company name.
    Find out more about how RoseCuteBear responds to requests for records or information about members of
    RoseCuteBear’s community in our Requests for Information Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong>
    RoseCuteBear is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them for a variety of purposes,
    including assisting us to perform and improve the Services. These businesses may sell items or services to you
    through the Services or, with your consent, offer promotions (including email promotions) to you.
    RoseCuteBear may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses, including providing
    information to such partners to allow them to more effectively market to you. When an affiliated business
    assists in facilitating your transaction, we may need to share information related to the transaction with
    that affiliated business in order to facilitate your transaction, and this forms part of the Services we
    provide in accordance with our Terms of Use. We rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at any time) to send
    marketing messages and for third-party sharing relating to advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Aggregated Information:</strong>
    RoseCuteBear may share demographic information with business partners, but it will be aggregated and
    de-personalized so that personal information is not revealed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Service Providers:</strong>
    RoseCuteBear also needs to engage third-party companies and individuals (such as payment processors, research
    companies, and analytics and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and market the Services. These
    third parties have only limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these
    tasks on our behalf, and are obligated to RoseCuteBear not to disclose or use your information for other
    purposes. Our engagement of service providers is often necessary for us to provide the Services to you,
    particularly where such companies play important roles like processing payments and shipments and helping us
    keep our Service operating and secure. In some other cases, these service providers aren’t strictly necessary
    for us to provide the Services, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we
    could better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service
    providers to make our Services better.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Business Reorganization:</strong>
    In some cases, RoseCuteBear may choose to buy or sell assets. Such transactions may be necessary and in our
    legitimate interests, particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our business to develop over
    the long term. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer
    of all or substantially all of RoseCuteBear’s assets), member information is typically one of the business
    assets that is transferred. If RoseCuteBear intends to transfer information about you, RoseCuteBear will notify
    you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site and the App, and you will be afforded an opportunity
    to opt out before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Third Parties:</strong>
    Third-party plug-ins also may collect information about your use of the Site. For example, when you load a
    page on RoseCuteBear that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a “Like” or “Send”
    button, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies directly from
    your browser. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party site. In addition,
    certain cookies and other similar technologies on the Site are used by third parties for targeted online
    marketing and other purposes. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device
    each time you use the Services. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own
    terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services. RoseCuteBear chooses and manages
    these third-party technologies placed on its Sites and Apps. However, these are third-party technologies, and

    We can speak only for ourselves; this policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (such as other
    members who sell using the Services, certain third-party providers on whom we rely to provide certain
    services, or API users) that RoseCuteBear does not own or control or individuals that RoseCuteBear does not employ
    or manage. If you provide your information to such third parties in connection with your use of the Services,
    different practices may apply to the use or disclosure of the information that you provide to them. While
    RoseCuteBear requires these third parties to follow RoseCuteBear’s privacy and security requirements,
    RoseCuteBear does not control the privacy or security policies of such third parties. To the full extent
    applicable in your jurisdiction, RoseCuteBear is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of these
    sellers, API users, or other websites on the internet, even those linked to or from the Services. We encourage
    you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal
    information to them. For the purposes of European law, these sellers, third party providers, and API users are
    independent controllers of data, which means that they are responsible for providing and complying with their
    own policies relating to any personal information they obtain in connection with the Services.

    Security
  </h2>

  <p>
    The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to
    protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it is received. Your
    account information is protected by a password. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access
    to your account and information by choosing your password carefully and by keeping your password and computer
    secure, such as by signing out after using the Services. If you have any questions about the security of your
    personal information, you can contact us at legal{{ $siteName }}.com.
  </p>
  <p>
    RoseCuteBear encrypts certain information (such as credit card numbers) using secure socket layer technology
    (SSL). RoseCuteBear follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted
    to us, both during transmission and after it is received. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the
    internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal
    information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. RoseCuteBear offers advanced security features and
    settings for members, such as two-factor authentication for signing in, full-site SSL, and sign in history and
    notifications; you can view more information in your account settings.

    Retention
  </h2>

  <p>
    RoseCuteBear will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this
    policy, for as long as your account is active (i.e., for the lifetime of your RoseCuteBear member account), as
    described in this policy, or as needed to provide the Services to you. If you no longer want RoseCuteBear to use
    your information to provide the Services to you, you may close your account. RoseCuteBear will retain and use
    your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required
    to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our
    agreements, and as otherwise described in this policy. In addition, RoseCuteBear sellers may also be required to
    retain and use your information in order to comply with their own legal obligations. Please note that closing
    your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account.
    We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief
    period of time, except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to improve site
    functionality, or we are legally obligated to retain them for longer time periods.

    If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public
    interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing
    your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for
    legal reasons. Where we use your personal data for direct marketing purposes, you can always object using the
    unsubscribe link in such communications or changing your account settings. Please note that some changes to
    your account settings may take a few days to take effect.
